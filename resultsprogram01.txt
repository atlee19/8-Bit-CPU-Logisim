Explanation of why the inc r1 doesn't work:

• We used the wrong 6 bit opcode as our translation target
• We used Function A + 1 which resulted in this opcode 111001
• We should have used B + 1 110101

To fix this would require a complete overhaul of the 6 karnaugh maps and
we have unfortunately run out of time.
